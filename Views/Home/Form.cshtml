@model LaytonTempleTours.Models.AvailableTime
@*@model LaytonTempleTours.Models.GroupInfo*@

@*Form: Once the user has selected a time, they will fill out a form that has the time set
    (i.e. part of the form, but not editable), but also allows the user to enter their information:
    o Name of Group
    o Size of Group
    o Email Address
    o Phone Number (Optional)
    When the user submits the data, we want to store their contact information and update the
    database to show that time slot as taken. After submitting the form, the user should be
    returned to the Home Page.*@

@*x will auto fill from previous date and time chosen on sign up page*@
